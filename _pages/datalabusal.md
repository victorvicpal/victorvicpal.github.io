Datalab started 4 years ago as an open and multidisciplinary group focused on Data Science.
I was part of the original founders and nowadays I am the coordinator of the group.
Since then multiple students and people have been part of it.

## First year

We established periodic meetings starting to build a community.
We also took part in different [Drivendata](www.drivendata.org/) competitions.

## Second year

We continued our engagement in competitions such as the University contest [Data Science Game](twitter.com/datasciencegame).
In March 2017 we won the [Hackforgood National Luca Award](https://www.salamanca24horas.com/texto-diario/mostrar/893993/equipo-trabajo-usal-gana-premio-nacional-luca-encuentro-hackforgood) with a socioeconomic Analysis of Colombia.

## Third year

This year we started from scratch due to the potential loss of members.
On the other hand, new young members joined the group. In order to gain machine learning skills we conducted different python workshops for them.
As result of this year, the new members participated in the 2018 HackForGood edition winning an award predicting air pollution in Madrid.

## Fourth year

We decided to change the focus of our group by develop a specific project along the year.
The project consisted on segmenting heart MRI images automatically. This project was awarded [1st in the Local HackForGood edition in Salamanca](https://www.salamanca24horas.com/texto-diario/mostrar/1365303/aplicacion-medical-datalab-agiliza-diagnostico-pacientes-gana-hackforgood-salamanca).

The group decided to start a [PyData meetUp](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/PyData-Salamanca/).

## Fifth year

One of our members won the PyConES 19 Poster 1st Award.
We are currently working on a Natural Language Processing project to analyze tweets sent to Spanish political figures (Male / Female).
